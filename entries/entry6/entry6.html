            <h2>OCTOBER 27TH SUNDAY 9:00PM</h2>

            <p>On the night of October 27th, a Sunday at around 9 PM, my friend and I made our way to Hutong on Lexington Avenue, after spending the day strolling along Fifth Avenue. The contrasting pace between the bustling shopping district and the serene elegance of Hutong was immediately apparent. The restaurant welcomed us with its sophisticated northern Chinese atmosphere, where traditional elements met sleek, modern design.</p>
            <p>We indulged in a selection of flavorful dishes. The standout for me was the Spicy Soft-Shell Crab, which offered just the right amount of heat without overpowering the dish. Another highlight was the Laoganma Beef, rich and savory, accompanied by a fragrant fried rice that tied everything together. The Chongqing noodles added a touch of spice and texture, rounding out the meal with a perfect balance of bold flavors. For dessert, the soy milk bao, with its soft texture and delicate sweetness, was easily the star, offering a unique and delightful end to our meal.</p>
