        <p>Tonight, I went to Mari Vanna, a cozy Russian-inspired restaurant in New York, with Feier, Patrick, and Joy. From the moment we stepped inside, it felt like entering a warm fairytale world—vintage decor, elegant chandeliers, and walls adorned with all kinds of cute trinkets. The entire place was perfect for taking photos! Every corner seemed like it could be the star of an Instagram post.</p>
        <p>We started with a few appetizers, including their classic Russian Dumplings (Pelmeni) and Caviar Platter—each bite was delightful. When the main courses arrived, we couldn’t stop taking pictures, especially the vibrant Sturgeon with Sour Cream, which looked like a work of art. Joy even joked that the photos alone made the dinner worth it.</p>
        <p>The entire meal was filled with laughter and good vibes. Patrick kept finding creative angles for photos, Feier worked on finding the best lighting for us, and Joy was busy trying out goofy poses. We chatted about so many fun topics, from recent work updates to holiday plans, and of course, we couldn’t skip sharing little complaints about everyday life.</p>
